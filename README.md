# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-

The following jupyter notebook reports my personal solution to the Kaggle challenge concerning the analysis of the Titanic database and the creation of a predictive system. 

My personal approach has been the following : 

- Data control and estimation of missing data (how many are there? why are they missing? )

- Using the frequency I realized histograms, pivot tables and correlation matrices to study how each column of the DB could be relevant or not for the next analysis. 

- I created and trained a MLP neural network to classify each passenger between "survivor" and "non survivor". 

- Using the information learned from the statistical analysis I trained the MLP and printed out the weights that the model assigned to each feature. 

The code is highly annotated and complete with a step-by-step explanation of the process and the data obtained.
